Abstract:This study provides a formal analysis of the customer targeting decision problemin settings where the cost for marketing action is stochastic and proposes aframework to efficiently estimate the decision variables for campaign profitoptimization. Targeting a customer is profitable if the positive impact of themarketing treatment on the customer and the associated profit to the company ishigher than the cost of the treatment. While there is a growing literature ondeveloping causal or uplift models to identify the customers who are impactedmost strongly by the marketing action, no research has investigated optimaltargeting when the costs of the action are uncertain at the time of thetargeting decision. Because marketing incentives are routinely conditioned on apositive response by the customer, e.g. a purchase or contract renewal,stochastic costs are ubiquitous in direct marketing and customer retentioncampaigns. This study makes two contributions to the literature, which areevaluated on a coupon targeting campaign in an e-commerce setting. First, theauthors formally analyze the targeting decision problem under response-dependentcosts. Profit-optimal targeting requires an estimate of the treatment effect onthe customer and an estimate of the customer response probability undertreatment. The empirical results demonstrate that the consideration of treatmentcost substantially increases campaign profit when used for customer targeting incombination with the estimation of the average or customer- level treatmenteffect. Second, the authors propose a framework to jointly estimate thetreatment effect and the response probability combining methods for causalinference with a hurdle mixture model. The proposed causal hurdle model achievescompetitive campaign profit while streamlining model building. The code for theempirical analysis is available on Github.Keywords:Heterogeneous Treatment Effect, Uplift Modeling, Coupon Targeting,Churn/Retention, Campaign Profit

Abstract:A multivariate quantile regression model with a factor structure is proposed tostudy data with many responses of interest. The factor structure is allowed tovary with the quantile levels, which makes our framework more flexible than theclassical factor models. The model is estimated with the nuclear normregularization in order to accommodate the high dimensionality of data, but theincurred optimization problem can only be efficiently solved in an approximatemanner by off-the-shelf optimization methods. Such a scenario is often seen whenthe empirical risk is non-smooth or the numerical procedure involves expensivesubroutines such as singular value decompo- sition. To ensure that theapproximate estimator accurately estimates the model, non-asymptotic bounds onerror of the the approximate estimator is established. For implementation, anumerical procedure that provably marginalizes the approximate error isproposed. The merits of our model and the proposed numerical procedures aredemonstrated through Monte Carlo experiments and an application to financeinvolving a large pool of asset returns.Keywords:Factor model, quantile regression, non-asymptotic analysis, multivariateregression, nuclear norm regularization

Abstract:Recently, a number of structured funds have emerged as public-privatepartnerships with the intent of promoting investment in renewable energy inemerging markets. These funds seek to attract institutional investors bytranching the asset pool and issuing senior notes with a high credit quality.Financing of renewable energy (RE) projects is achieved via two channels: smallRE projects are financed indirectly through local banks that draw loans from thefund’s assets, whereas large RE projects are directly financed from the fund. Ina bottom-up Gaussian copula framework, we examine the diversification propertiesand RE exposure of the senior tranche. To this end, we introduce the LH++ model,which combines a homogeneous infinitely granular loan portfolio with a finitenumber of large loans. Using expected tranche percentage notional (which takes asimilar role as the default probability of a loan), tranche prices and tranchesensitivities in RE loans, we analyse the risk profile of the senior tranche. Weshow how the mix of indirect and direct RE investments in the asset pool affectsthe sensitivity of the senior tranche to RE investments and how to balance adesired sensitivity with a target credit quality and target tranche size.Keywords:Renewable energy financing, structured finance, CDO pricing, LH++ model

Abstract:The paper estimates banks’ total factor efficiency (TFE) as well as TFE of eachproduction factor by incorporating banks’ overall risk endogenously into bank’sproduction process as undesirable by-product in a Global-SMB Model. Our resultsshow that, compared with a model incorporated with banks’ overall risk, a modelconsidering only on-balance-sheet risk may over-estimate the integrated TFE(TFIE) and under-estimate TFE volatility. Significant heterogeneities of bankTFIE and TFE of each production factor exist among banks of different types andregions, as a result of still prominent unbalanced development of Chinesecommercial banks. Based on the estimated TFIE, the paper further investigatesthe determinants of bank efficiency, and finds that shadow banking, bank size,NPL ratio, loan to deposit ratio, fiscal surplus to GDP ratio and banking sectorconcentration are significant determinants of bank efficiency. Besides, a modelwith risk-weighted assets as undesirable outputs can better capture the impactof shadow banking involvement.Keywords:Nonparametric Methods, Commercial Banks, Shadow Bank, Financial Risk

Abstract:The predictability of a high-dimensional time series model in forecasting withlarge information sets depends not only on the stability of parameters but alsodepends heavily on the active covariates in the model. Since the true empiricalenvironment can change as time goes by, the variables that function well at thepresent may become useless in the future. Combined with the instable parameters,finding the most active covariates in the parameter time-varying situationsbecomes difficult. In this paper, we aim to propose a new method, the PenalizedAdaptive Method (PAM), which can adaptively detect the parameter homogeneousintervals and simultaneously select the active variables in sparse models. Thenewly developed method is able to identify the parameters stability at one handand meanwhile, at the other hand, can manage of selecting the active forecastingcovariates at every different time point. Comparing with the classical models,the method can be applied to high-dimensional cases with different sources ofparameter changes while it steadily reduces the forecast error in high-dimensional data. In the out-of-sample bond risk premia forecasting, thePenalized Adaptive Method can reduce the forecasting error(RMSPE and MAPE)around 24% to 50% comparing with the other forecasting methods.Keywords:SCAD penalty, propagation-separation, adaptive window choice, multiplierbootstrap, bond risk premia

Abstract:The shift of human communication to online platforms brings many benefits tosociety due to the ease of publication of opinions, sharing experience, gettingimmediate feedback and the opportunity to discuss the hottest topics. Besidesthat, it builds up a space for antisocial behavior such as harassment, insultand hate speech. This research is dedicated to detection of antisocial onlinebehavior detection (AOB) - an umbrella term for cyberbullying, hate speech,cyberaggression and use of any hateful textual content. First, we provide abenchmark of deep learning models found in the literature on AOB detection. Deeplearning has already proved to be efficient in different types of decisionsupport: decision support from financial disclosures, predicting processbehavior, text-based emoticon recognition. We compare methods of traditionalmachine learning with deep learning, while applying important advancements ofnatural language processing: we examine bidirectional encoding, compareattention mechanisms with simpler reduction techniques, and investigate whetherthe hierarchical representation of the data and application of attention ondifferent layers might improve the predictive performance. As a partialcontribution of the final hierarchical part, we introduce pseudo-sentencehierarchical attention network, an extension of hierarchical attention network –a recent advancement in document classification.Keywords:Deep Learning, Cyberbullying, Antisocial Online Behavior, Attention Mechanism,Text Classification

Group Average Treatment Effects for Observational Studies   Daniel Jacob Wolfgang Karl Härdle Stefan Lessmann   Abstract: The paper proposes an estimator to make inference of heterogeneous treatment effects sorted by impact groups (GATES) for non-randomised experiments. Observational studies are standard in policy evaluation from labour markets, educational surveys and other empirical studies. To control for a potential selection-bias we implement a doubly-robust estimator in the first stage. Keeping the flexibility, we can use any machine learning method to learn the conditional mean functions as well as the propensity score. We also use machine learning methods to learn a function for the conditional average treatment effect. The group average treatment effect, is then estimated via a parametric linear model to provide p-values and confidence intervals. To control for confounding in the linear model we use Neyman-orthogonal moments to partial out the effect that covariates have on both, the treatment assignment and the outcome. The result is a best linear predictor for effect heterogeneity based on impact groups. We introduce inclusion-probability weighting as a form of cross-splitting and averaging for each observation to avoid biases through sample splitting. The advantage of the proposed method is a robust linear estimation of heterogeneous group treatment effects in observational studies.

Abstract:Public interest, explosive returns, and diversification opportunities gavestimulus to the adoption of traditional financial tools to crypto-currencies.While the CRIX index offered the first scientifically-backed proxy to thecrypto- market (analogous to S&P 500), the introduction of Bitcoin futures byCboe became the milestone in the creation of the derivatives market for crypto-currencies. Following the intuition of the "fear index" VIX for the Americanstock market, the VCRIX volatility index was created to capture the investorexpectations about the crypto-currency ecosystem. VCRIX is built based on CRIXand offers a forecast for the mean annualized volatility of the next 30 days,re-estimated daily. The model was back-tested for its forecasting power,resulting in low MSE performance and further examined by the simulation of VIX(resulting in a correlation of 78% between the actual VIX and VIX estimated withthe VCRIX model). VCRIX provides forecasting functionality and serves as a proxyfor the investors’ expectations in the absence of the de- veloped derivativesmarket. These features provide enhanced decision making capacities for marketmonitoring, trading strategies, and potentially option pricing.Keywords:index construction, volatility, crypto-currency, VCRIX

Abstract:Customer scoring models are the core of scalable direct marketing. Uplift modelsprovide an estimate of the incremental benefit from a treatment that is used foroperational decision-making. Training and monitoring of uplift models requireexperimental data. However, the collection of data under randomized treatmentassignment is costly, since random targeting deviates from an establishedtargeting policy. To increase the cost-efficiency of experimentation andfacilitate frequent data collection and model training, we introduce supervisedrandomization. It is a novel approach that integrates existing scoring modelsinto randomized trials to target relevant customers, while ensuring consistentestimates of treatment effects through correction for active sample selection.An empirical Monte Carlo study shows that data collection under supervisedrandomization is cost-efficient, while downstream uplift models performcompetitively.Keywords:Uplift Modeling, Causal Inference, Experimental Design, Selection Bias

Abstract:The integration of social media characteristics into an econometric frameworkrequires modeling a high dimensional dynamic network with dimensions ofparameter Θ typically much larger than the number of observations. To cope withthis problem, we introduce a new structural model — SONIC which assumes that(1) a few influencers drive the network dynamics; (2) the community structure ofthe network is characterized as the homogeneity of response to the specificinfluencer, implying their underlying similarity. An estimation procedure isproposed based on a greedy algorithm and LASSO regularization. Throughtheoretical study and simulations, we show that the matrix parameter can beestimated even when the observed time interval is smaller than the size of thenetwork. Using a novel dataset retrieved from a leading social media platform–StockTwits and quantifying their opinions via natural language processing, wemodel the opinions network dynamics among a select group of users and furtherdetect the latent communities. With a sparsity regularization, we can identifyimportant nodes in the network.Keywords:social media, network, community, opinion mining, natural language processing

Abstract:Among all the emerging markets, the cryptocurrency market is considered the mostcontroversial and simultaneously the most interesting one. The visiblysignificant market capitalization of cryptos motivates modern financialinstruments such as futures and options. Those will depend on the dynamics,volatility, or even the jumps of cryptos. In this paper, the riskcharacteristics for Bitcoin are analyzed from a realized volatility dynamicsview. The realized variance RV is estimated with (threshold-)jump components(T)J, semivariance RSV+(−) , and signed jumps (T)J+(−) . Our empirical resultsshow that the Bitcoin market is far riskier than any other developed financialmarket. Up to 68% of the sample days are identified to entangle jumps. However,the discontinuities do not contribute to the variance significantly. Byemploying a 90-day rolling-window method, the in-sample evidence suggests thatthe impacts of predictors change over time systematically under HAR-type models.The out-of-sample forecasting results reveal that the forecasting horizonplays an important role in choosing forecasting models. For long-horizon riskforecast, a finer model calibrated with jumps gives extra utility up to 20 basispoints annually, while an approach based on the roughest estimators suits theshort-horizon risk forecast best. Last but not least, a simple equal-weightedportfolio not only significantly reduces the size and quantity of jumps but alsogives investors higher utility in short-horizon risk forecast case.Keywords:Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, Realized Variance, Thresholded Jump, Signed Jumps,Realized Utility

Abstract:The paper examines the potential of deep learning to produce decision supportmodels from structured, tabular data. Considering the context of financial riskmanagement, we develop a deep learning model for predicting whether individualspread traders are likely to secure profits from future trades. This embodiestypical modeling challenges faced in risk and behavior forecasting. Conventionalmachine learning requires data that is representative of the feature-targetrelationship and relies on the often costly development, maintenance, andrevision of handcrafted features. Consequently, modeling highly variable,heterogeneous patterns such as the behavior of traders is challenging. Deeplearning promises a remedy. Learning hierarchical distributed representations ofthe raw data in an automatic manner (e.g. risk taking behavior), it uncoversgenerative features that determine the target (e.g., trader’s profitability),avoids manual feature engineering, and is more robust toward change (e.g.dynamic market conditions). The results of employing a deep network foroperational risk forecasting confirm the feature learning capability of deeplearning, provide guidance on designing a suitable network architecture anddemonstrate the superiority of deep learning over machine learning and rule-based benchmarks.Keywords:risk management, retail finance, forecasting, deep learning

Abstract:The importance of startups for a dynamic, innovative and competitive economy hasalready been acknowledged in the scientific and business literature. The highlyuncertain and volatile nature of the startup ecosystem makes the evaluation ofstartup success through analysis and interpretation of information very timeconsuming and computationally intensive. This prediction problem brings forwardthe need for a quantitative model, which should enable an objective and fact-based approach to startup success prediction. This paper presents a series ofreproducible models for startup success prediction, using machine learningmethods. The data used for this purpose was received from the online investorplatform, crunchbase.com. The data has been pre-processed for sampling bias andimbalance by using the oversampling approach, ADASYN. A total of six differentmodels are implemented to predict startup success. Using goodness-of-fitmeasures, applicable to each model case, the best models selected are theensemble methods, random forest and extreme gradient boosting with a test setprediction accuracy of 94.1% and 94.5% and AUC of 92.22% and 92.91%respectively. Top variables in these models are last funding to date, firstfunding lag and company age. The models presented in this study can be used topredict success rate for future new firms/ventures in a repeatable way.Keywords:Machine learning

Abstract:A daily systemic risk measure is proposed accounting for links and mutualdependencies between financial institutions utilising tail event information. FRM(Financial Risk Meter) is based on Lasso quantile regression designed to capturetail event co-movements. The FRM focus lies on understanding active set datacharacteristics and the presentation of interdependencies in a network topology.Two FRM indices are presented, namely, FRM@Americas and FRM@Europe. The FRMindices detect systemic risk at selected areas and identifies risk factors. Inpractice, FRM is applied to the return time series of selected financialinstitutions and macroeconomic risk factors. Using FRM on a daily basis, weidentify companies exhibiting extreme "co-stress", as well as "activators" ofstress. With the SRM@EuroArea, we extend to the government bond asset class. FRMis a good predictor for recession probabilities, constituting the FRM-impliedrecession probabilities. Thereby, FRM indicates tail event behaviour in anetwork of financial risk factors.Keywords:Systemic Risk, Quantile Regression, Financial Markets, Risk Management, NetworkDynamics, Recession

Abstract:We propose an approach to calibrate the conditional value-at-risk (CoVaR) offinancial institutions based on neural network quantile regression. Building onthe estimation results we model systemic risk spillover effects across banks byconsidering the marginal effects of the quantile regression procedure. We adopt adropout regularization procedure to remedy the well-known issue of overfittingfor neural networks, and we provide empirical evidence for the favorable out-of-sample performance of a regularized neural network. We then propose threemeasures for systemic risk from our fitted results. We find that systemic riskincreases sharply during the height of the financial crisis in 2008 and againafter a short period of easing in 2011 and 2015. Our approach also allowsidentifying systemically relevant firms during the financial crisis.Keywords:Systemic risk, CoVaR, Quantile regression, Neural networks

Abstract:The aim of this paper is to prove the phenotypic convergence ofcryptocurrencies, in the sense that individual cryptocurrencies respond tosimilar selection pressures by developing similar characteristics. In order toretrieve the cryptocurrencies phenotype, we treat cryptocurrencies as financialinstruments (genus proximum) and find their specific difference (differentia specifica) by using the daily time series of log-returns. In this sense, a daily timeseries of asset returns (either cryptocurrencies or classical assets) can becharacterized by a multidimensional vector with statistical components likevolatility, skewness, kurtosis, tail probability, quantiles, conditional tailexpectation or fractal dimension. By using dimension reduction techniques(Factor Analysis) and classification models (Binary Logistic Regression,Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machines, K-means clustering, VarianceComponents Split methods) for a representative sample of cryptocurrencies,stocks, exchange rates and commodities, we are able to classify cryptocurrenciesas a new asset class with unique features in the tails of the log-returnsdistribution. The main result of our paper is the complete separation of thecryptocurrencies from the other type of assets, by using the Maximum VarianceComponents Split method. More, we observe a divergent evolution of thecryptocurrencies species, compared to the classical assets, mainly due to thetails behaviour of the log-returns distribution.

Abstract:The paper presents a systematic theory for asymptotic inferences based onautocovariances of stationary processes. We consider nonparametric tests for serial correlations using the maximum and the quadratic deviations of sampleautocovariances. For these cases, with proper centering and rescaling, theasymptotic distributions of the deviations are Gumbel and Gaussian, respectively. To establish such an asymptotic theory, as byproducts, we develop anormal comparison principle and propose a sufficient condition for summabilityof joint cumulants of stationary processes. We adapt a blocks of blocksbootstrapping procedure proposed by Kuensch (1989) and Liu and Singh (1992) tothe maximum deviation based tests to improve the finite-sample performance.Keywords:Autocovariance, blocks of blocks bootstrapping, Box-Pierce test, extreme valuedistribution, moderate deviation, normal comparison, physical dependencemeasure, short range dependence, stationary process, summability of cumulants

Abstract:The 2017 bubble on the cryptocurrency market recalls our memory in the dot-combubble, during which hard-to-measure fundamentals and investors’ illusion forbrand new technologies led to overvalued prices. Benefiting from the massiveincrease in the volume of messages published on social media and message boards,we examine the impact of investor sentiment, conditional on bubble regimes, oncryptocurrencies aggregate return prediction. Constructing a crypto-specificlexicon and using a local-momentum autoregression model, we find that thesentiment effect is prolonged and sustained during the bubble while it turns outa reversal effect once the bubble collapsed. The out-of-sample analysis alongwith portfolio analysis is conducted in this study. When measuring investorsentiment for a new type of asset such as cryptocurrencies, we highlight thatthe impact of investor sentiment on cryptocurrency returns is conditional onbubble regimes.Keywords:Cryptocurrency; Sentiment; Bubble; Return Predictability

Abstract:Increasingly volatile and distributed energy production challenge traditionalmechanisms to manage grid loads and price energy. Local energy markets (LEMs)may be a response to those challenges as they can balance energy production andconsumption locally and may lower energy costs for consumers. Blockchain-basedLEMs provide a decentralized market to local energy consumer and prosumers. Theyimplement a market mechanism in the form of a smart contract without the needfor a central authority coordinating the market. Recently proposed blockchain-based LEMs use auction designs to match future demand and supply. Thus, suchblockchain-based LEMs rely on accurate short-term forecasts of individualhouseholds’ energy consumption and production. Often, such accurate forecastsare simply assumed to be given. The present research tests this assumption.First, by evaluating the forecast accuracy achievable with state-of-the-artenergy forecasting techniques for individual households and, second, byassessing the effect of prediction errors on market outcomes in three differentsupply scenarios. The evaluation shows that, although a LASSO regression modelis capable of achieving reasonably low forecasting errors, the costly settlementof prediction errors can offset and even surpass the savings brought toconsumers by a blockchain-based LEM. This shows, that due to prediction errors,participation in LEMs may be uneconomical for consumers, and thus, has to betaken into consideration for pricing mechanisms in blockchain-based LEMs.Keywords:Blockchain; Local Energy Market; Smart Contract; Machine Learning; Household;Energy Prediction; Prediction Errors; Market Mechanism

Abstract:We consider a new procedure for detecting structural breaks in mean for high-dimensional time series. We target breaks happening at unknown time points andlocations. In particular, at a fixed time point our method is concerned witheither the biggest break in one location or aggregating simultaneous breaks overmultiple locations. We allow for both big or small sized breaks, so that we ca), stamp the dates and the locations of the breaks, 2), estimate the breaksizes and 3), make inference on the break sizes as well as the break dates. Ourtheoretical setup incorporates both temporal and crosssectional dependence, andis suitable for heavy-tailed innovations. We derive the asymptotic distributionfor the sizes of the breaks by extending the existing powerful theory on locallinear kernel estimation and high dimensional Gaussian approximation to allowfor trend stationary time series with jumps. A robust long-run covariance matrixestimation is proposed, which can be of independent interest. An application ondetecting structural changes of the US unemployment rate is considered toillustrate the usefulness of our method.Keywords:high-dimensional time series, multiple change-points, Gaussian approximation,nonparametric estimation, heavy tailed, long-run covariance matrix

Abstract:In this paper, we build an overlapping generation model to examine the reasonwhy developed countries with similar background have implemented differentsocial health insurance systems. We propose two hypotheses to explain thisphenomenon: (i) the different participation rates of the poor in the voting;(ii) the distinct attitudes towards the size of the government and the existenceof a compulsory social health insurance system. Agents need to vote for one oftwo policies: Policy I without Social Health Insurance (SHI) but with thesubsidy for the poor, and Policy II with fully covered SHI. By comparing eithertheir current utility or the expected life time utility, households will chooseone policy. We find that under Policy I, the derivative of the changes ofexpected utility with respect to income is not monotonic. This means that boththe poorest and the richest dislike the social health insurance system. With thecalibrated parameters, we solve the benchmark and find that the public’sattitude towards the size of the government and the lower representation of thepoor affect the election result. The changes in the minimum consumption levelunder Policy I affect the voting results most, followed by the attitude. VotingParticipant rate plays the most insignificant role in the voting outcome. Thesensitivity analysis shows that our main findings are robust to the inputparameters.Keywords:Social Health Insurance, Voting

Abstract:In this paper, we develop an multi period overlapping generation framework toinvestigate agents' consumption and saving decisions, inequality and welfareamong elderly. We assume that agents are heterogeneous in the non-asset incomeand the medical expenditure. In order to explicitly analyze the e ects ofmedical expenditure, we conduct three counterfactual exercises. We successivelyshut down the heterogeneity in labor income, in the level and in the dispersionof medical expenses respectively. By comparing the benchmark with thecounterfactual results, we  nd that in general wealth inequality decreases withage, and income uncertainty contributes the most to wealth inequality. Bothaverage consumption and consumption inequality increase with age. Consumptioninequality largely tracks income inequality. Though uncertainty in medicalexpenditures has little e ect on consumption inequality, a higher level ofmedical expenditures may exacerbate consumption inequality. Meanwhile, theaverage saving of elderly exhibits an inverse-U shape with age. The impacts onaverage saving are similar both in benchmark and in counterfactual exercises.Welfare increases with age.Keywords:Income Inequality, Social Mobility, Price-to-rent ratio

Abstract:Housing typically takes up a major proportion of households' expenditure, andthus it certainly plays a critical role in shaping the pattern of income in-equality and social mobility. Whether high housing price-to-rent ratio will am-plify inequality and inhibit social class upgrading is still a controversialissue in the existing literature. In this paper, we develop a partialequilibrium life- cycle framework to address these issues. Agents in our economyare divided into two social classes according to the initial human capital levelinherited from their parents. Those who belong to upper class will draw theirinnate abilities from a distribution that  rst order stochastically dominatesthose from lower class. Throughout the entire lifecycle, agents make endogenoushuman capital investment and housing tenure decisions. We calibrate the model tomimic some stylized facts in the the real world counter part. Our simulationresults indicate an inverse-U pattern between housing price-to-rent ratio andmeasures of income inequality, and as well as a U-shape pattern between price-to-rent ratio and social mobility measured by Shorrocks Index. The implicationis that housing tends to amplify the inequality and slow down the socialmobility when houses can only be purchased by a small group of agents in theeconomy. Moreover, our results also suggest that better quality of education asa result of a higher return to human capital investment tends to dampen the roleof housing.Keywords:Income Inequality, Social Mobility, Price-to-rent ratio

Abstract:Cryptocurrencies are becoming an attractive asset class and are the focus ofrecent quantitative research. The joint dynamics of the cryptocurrency marketyields information on network risk. Utilizing the adaptive LASSO approach, webuild a dynamic network of cryptocurrencies and model the latent communitieswith a dynamic stochastic blockmodel. We develop a dynamic covariate-assistedspectral clustering method to uniformly estimate the latent group membership ofcryptocurrencies consistently. We show that return inter-predictability andcrypto characteristics, including hashing algorithms and proof types, jointlydetermine the crypto market segmentation. Based on this classification result,it is natural to employ eigenvector centrality to identify a cryptocurrency’sidiosyncratic risk. An asset pricing analysis finds that a cross-sectionalportfolio with a higher centrality earns a higher risk premium. Further testsconfirm that centrality serves as a risk factor well and delivers valuableinformation content on cryptocurrency markets.Keywords:Community Detection, Dynamic Stochastic Blockmodel, Spectral Clustering, NodeCovariate, Return Predictability, Portfolio Management

Abstract:Risk transmission among financial markets and their participants is time-evolving, especially for the extreme risk scenarios. Possibly sudden timevariation of such risk structures ask for quantitative technology that is ableto cope with such situations. Here we present a novel localized multivariateCAViaR-type model to respond to the challenge of time-varying risk contagion.For this purpose a local adaptive approach determines homogeneous, low riskvariation intervals at each time point. Critical values for this technique arecalculated via multiplier bootstrap, and the statistical properties of this“localized multivariate CAViaR” are derived. A comprehensive simulation studysupports the effectiveness of our approach in detecting structural change inmultivariate CAViaR. Finally, when applying for the US and German financialmarkets, we can trace out the dynamic tail risk spillovers and find that the USmarket appears to play dominate role in risk transmissions, especially involatile market periods.Keywords:conditional quantile autoregression, local parametric approach, change pointdetection, multiplier bootstrap

Abstract:Understanding the topological structure of real world networks is of hugeinterest in a variety of fields. One of the way to investigate this structure isto find the groups of densely connected nodes called communities. This paperpresents a new non-parametric method of community detection in networks calledAdaptive Weights Community Detection. The idea of the algorithm is to associatea local community for each node. On every iteration the algorithm tests ahypothesis that two nodes are in the same community by comparing their localcommunities. The test rejects the hypothesis if the density of edges betweenthese two local communities is lower than the density inside each one. Adetailed performance analysis of the method shows its dominance over state-of-the-art methods on well known artificial and real world benchmarks.Keywords:Adaptive weights, Gap coefficient, Graph clustering, Nonparametric, Overlappingcommunities

Abstract:This paper provides a detailed framework for modeling portfolios, achieving thehighest growth rate under subjective risk constraints such as Value at Risk(VaR) in the presence of stable laws. Although the maximization of the expectedlogarithm of wealth induces outperforming any other significantly differentstrategy, the Kelly Criterion implies larger bets than a risk-averse investorwould accept. Restricting the Kelly optimization by spectral risk measures, theauthors provide a generalized mapping for different measures of growth andsecurity. Analyzing over 30 years of S&P 500 returns for different samplingfrequencies, the authors find evidence for leptokurtic behavior for allrespective sampling frequencies. Given that lower sampling frequencies imply asmaller number of data points, this paper argues in favor of α-stable laws andits scaling behavior to model financial market returns for a given horizon in ani.i.d. world. Instead of simulating from the class of elliptically stabledistributions, a nonparametric scaling approximation, based on the data-setitself, is proposed. Our paper also uncovers that including long put optionsinto the portfolio optimization, improves the growth criterion for a givensecurity level, leading to a new Kelly portfolio providing the highest geometricmean.Keywords:growth-optimal, Kelly criterion, protective put, portfolio optimization, stabledistribution, Value at Risk

For the respective data frequencies, theauthors show in a simulation and backtest study that available data series arenot sufficient in order to estimate Value at Risk and Expected Shortfallsufficiently, given confidence levels of 99.9% and 99.99%. Accordingly, thispaper presents a semi-parametric estimation method, rescaling data from high- tolow-frequency which allows to obtain significantly more data points for theestimation of the respective risk measures. The presented methodology in theα-stable framework, which is able to mimic multifractal behavior in assetreturns, provides tail events which never occurred in the original low-frequencydataset.Keywords:high-frequency, multifractal, stable distribution, rescaling, risk management,Value at Risk, quantile distribution

In order to give the most-likely format of theinteractions between news arrival and stock market behaviors, these two modelsare compared with several other easier versions of GARCH-type models based onthe calibration results on DJIA 30 stocks. The necessity to include newsprocesses in intraday stock volatility modeling is justified in our specificcalibration samples (2008 and 2013, respectively). While it is not as profitableto model jump process separately as using simpler GARCH process with errordistribution capable to capture fat tail behaviors of financial time series. Inconclusion, our calibration results suggest GARCH-news model with skew-tinnovation distribution as the best candidate for intraday returns of largestocks in US market, which means one can probably avoid the complicatedness ofmodelling jump behavior by using a simplier skew-t error distribution assumptioninstead, but it’s necessary to incorporate news variables.Keywords:information arrival, volatility modeling, jump, sentiment, GARCH

Abstract:Excessive house price growth was at the heart of the financial crisis i07/08. Since then, many countries have added cooling measures to theirregulatory frameworks. It has been found that these measures can indeed controlprice growth, but no one has examined whether this has adverse consequences forthe housing wealth distribution. We examine this for Singapore, which started i09 to target price growth over ten rounds in total. We find that welfare fromhousing wealth in the last round might not be higher than before 2009. Thisdepends on the deflator used to convert nominal into real prices. Irrespectiveof the deflator, we can reject that welfare increased monotonically over thedifferent rounds.Keywords:house price distribution, stochastic dominance tests

Abstract:Second-hand car markets contribute to billions of Euro turnover each year buthardly generate profit for used car dealers. The paper examines the potential ofsophisticated data-driven pricing systems to enhance supplier-side decision-making and escape the zero-profit-trap. Profit maximization requires an accurateunderstanding of demand. The paper identifies factors that characterize consumerdemand and proposes a framework to estimate demand functions using survivalanalysis. Empirical analysis of a large data set of daily used car sales betwee08 to 2012 confirm the merit of the new factors. Observed results also showthe value of survival analysis to explain and predict demand. Random survivalforest emerges as the most suitable vehicle to develop price response functionsas input for a dynamic pricing system.Keywords:Automotive Industry, Price Optimization, Survival Analysis, Dynamic Pricing

Abstract: A copula model with flexibly specified dependence structure can be useful to capture the complexity and heterogeneity in economic and financial time series. However, there exists little methodological guidance for the specification process using copulas. This paper contributes to fill this gap by considering the recently proposed single-index copulas, for which we propose a simultaneous estimation and variable selection procedure. The proposed method allows to choose the most relevant state variables from a comprehensive set using a penalized estimation, and we derive its large sample properties. Simulation results demonstrate the good performance of the proposed method in selecting the appropriate state variables and estimating the unknown index coefficients and dependence parameters. An application of the new procedure identifies six macroeconomic driving factors for the dependence among U.S. housing markets.

Abstract The estimation of a causal parameter in a high-dimensional setting where the functions are potentially complex is a challenging task. Parametric and linear modelling is not sufficient to generate unbiased and consistent estimators. Modern approaches, therefore, use machine learning (ML) algorithms to learn these nuisance functions. However, this leads to new problems like the regularization bias or overfitting that are common when using ML models. This paper considers different novel methods that overcome these problems or at least address them. These methods differ in terms of the target parameter, namely the average treatment effect of the population, group heterogeneity or the conditional average treatment effect for each individual. Each method is first investigated and tested separately and second, they are compared among each other. To do this in a disciplined manner, simulations with synthetic data are used. This ensures that all distributions of the generated treatment effect parameters are known. The findings are that each method has its limits in terms of unbiased estimation, the detection of heterogeneity and also the determination of which covariates are responsible for different causal effects.

Abstract Uplift modeling combines machine learning and experimental strategies to estimate the differential effect of a treatment on individuals behavior. The paper considers uplift models in the scope of marketing campaign targeting. Literature on uplift modeling strategies is fragmented across academic disciplines and lacks an overarching empirical comparison. Using data from online retailers, we fill this gap and contribute to literature through consolidating prior work on uplift modeling and systematically comparing the predictive performance and utility of available uplift modeling strategies. Our empirical study includes three experiments in which we examine the interaction between an uplift modeling strategy and the underlying machine learning algorithm to implement the strategy, quantify model performance in terms of business value and demonstrate the advantages of uplift models over response models, which are widely used in marketing. The results facilitate making specific recommendations how to deploy uplift models in e-commerce applications.

Asymptotic properties are presented for sample RINFIN that is successful in extracting indications for in uential and bad leverage cases in microarray data and simulated, high dimensional data. Its performance improves as p increases and can also be used in multiple response linear regression. RINFIN's advantage is that, whereas in in uence functions of -regression coecients each x-coordinate and r(x; y) appear in a sum as product with moderate size when (x; y) is bad leverage case and masking makes r(x; y) nearly vanish, RINFIN's x-partial derivatives convert the product in sum allowing for unmasking.

Abstract High-dimensional, streaming datasets are ubiquitous in modern applications. Examples range from nance and e-commerce to the study of biomedical and neuroimaging data. As a result, many novel algorithms have been proposed to address challenges posed by such datasets. In this work, we focus on the use of - regularized linear models in the context of (possibly non-stationary) streaming data. Recently, it has been noted that the choice of the regularization parameter is fundamental in such models and several methods have been proposed which iteratively tune such a parameter in a time-varying manner, thereby allowing the underlying sparsity of estimated models to vary. Moreover, in many applications, inference on the regularization parameter may itself be of interest, as such a parameter is related to the underlying sparsity of the model. However, in this work, we highlight and provide extensive empirical evidence regarding how various (often unrelated) statistical properties in the data can lead to changes in the regularization parameter. In particular, through various synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that changes in the regularization parameter may be driven by changes in the true underlying sparsity, signal-to-noise ratio or even model misspecication. The purpose of this letter is, therefore, to highlight and catalog various statistical properties which induce changes in the associated regularization parameter. We conclude by presenting two applications: one relating to nancial data and another to neuroimaging data, where the aforementioned discussion is relevant.

Abstract The market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has risen rapidly during the last few years. Despite their high volatility, this fact has spurred growing interest in cryptocurrencies as an alternative investment asset for portfolio and risk management. We characterise the effects of adding cryptocurrencies in addition to traditional assets to the set of eligible assets in portfolio management. Out-of-sample performance and diversification benefits are studied for the most popular portfolio-construction rules, including mean-variance optimization, risk-parity, and maximum-diversification strategies, as well as combined strategies.  To account for the frequently low liquidity of cryptocurrency markets we incorporate the LIBRO method, which gives suitable liquidity constraints. Our results show that cryptocurrencies can improve the risk-return profile of portfolios. In particular, cryptocurrencies are more useful for portfolio strategies with higher target returns; they do not play a role in minimum-variance portfolios. However, a maximum-diversification strategy (maximising the Portfolio Diversification Index, PDI) draws appreciably on cryptocurrencies, and spanning tests clearly indicate that cryptocurrency returns are non-redundant additions to the investment universe.

Abstract Modeling the joint tails of multiple nancial time series has important im- plications for risk management. Classical models for dependence often encounter a lack of t in the joint tails, calling for additional  exibility. In this paper we introduce a new nonparametric time-varying mixture copula model, in which both weights and depen- dence parameters are deterministic functions of time. We propose penalized trending mixture copula models with group smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penal- ty functions to do the estimation and copula selection simultaneously. Monte Carlo simulation results suggest that the shrinkage estimation procedure performs well in s- electing and estimating both constant and trending mixture copula models. Using the proposed model and method, we analyze the evolution of the dependence among four international stock markets, and nd substantial changes in the levels and patterns of the dependence, in particular around crisis periods.

We also study the benefits of the Metcalfe's law (the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system) for the evaluation of cryptocurrencies. As the results showed a potential for herding behaviour, we used LPPL models to capture the behaviour of cryptocurrencies exchange rates during an endogenous bubble and to predict the most probable time of the regime switching.

Abstract An extensive empirical literature documents a generally negative relation, named the leverage effect, between asset returns and changes of volatility. It is more challenging to establish such a return-volatility relationship for jumps in high-frequency data. We propose new nonparametric methods to assess and test for a discontinuous leverage effect  i.e. a covariation between contemporaneous jumps in prices and volatility. The methods are robust to market microstructure noise and build on a newly developed price-jump localization and estimation procedure. Our empirical investigation of six years of transaction data from 320 NASDAQ firms displays no unconditional negative covariation between price and volatility cojumps. We show, however, that there is a strong and significant discontinuous leverage effect if one conditions on the sign of price jumps and whether the price jumps are market-wide or idiosyncratic.

Abstract Open-ended responses are widely used in market research studies. Processing of such responses requires labor-intensive human coding. This paper focuses on unsupervised topic models and tests their ability to automate the analysis of open-ended responses. Since state-ofthe- art topic models struggle with the shortness of open-ended responses, the paper considers three novel short text topic models: Latent Feature Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Biterm Topic Model and Word Network Topic Model. The models are fitted and evaluated on a set of realworld open-ended responses provided by a market research company. Multiple components such as topic coherence and document classification are quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated to appraise whether topic models can replace human coding. The results suggest that topic models are a viable alternative for open-ended response coding. However, their usefulness is limited when a correct one-to-one mapping of responses and topics or the exact topic distribution is needed.

Abstract This paper studies the short-run impacts of temperature on human performance in the computer-mediated environment using server logs of a popular online game in China. Taking advantage of the quasi-experiment of winter central heating policy inChina, we distinguish the impacts of outdoor and indoor temperature and find that low temperatures below 5 ?C decrease game performance significantly. Non-experienced players suffered larger performance drop than experienced ones. Access to central heating attenuates negative impacts of low outdoor temperatures on gamers performance. High temperatures above 21 ?C also lead to drops in game performance.We conclude that expanding the current central heating zone will bring an increase in human performance by approximately 4% in Shanghai and surrounding provinces in the winter. While often perceived as a leisure activity, online gaming requires intense engagement and the deployment of cognitive, social, and motor skills, which are also key skills for productive activities. Our results draw attention to potential damages of extreme temperature on human performance in the modern computer-mediated environment.

Abstract In this article, we study a nonparametric approach regarding a general nonlinear reduced form equation to achieve a better approximation of the optimal instrument. Accordingly, we propose the nonparametric additive instrumental variable estimator (NAIVE) with the adaptive group Lasso.We theoretically demonstrate that the proposed estimator is root-n consistent and asymptotically normal. The adaptive group Lasso helps us select the valid instruments while the dimensionality of potential instrumental variables is allowed to be greater than the sample size. In practice, the degree and knots of B-spline series are selected by minimizing the BIC or EBIC criteria for each nonparametric additive component in the reduced form equation. In Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the NAIVE has the same performance as the linear instrumental variable (IV) estimator for the truly linear reduced form equation. On the other hand, the NAIVE performs much better in terms of bias and mean squared errors compared to other alternative estimators under the high-dimensional nonlinear reduced form equation. We further illustrate our method in an empirical study of international trade and growth. Our findings provide  Keywords:  Adaptive group Lasso; Instrumental variables; Nonparametric additive model; Optimal estimator; Variable selection.

Abstract The conventional wisdom that housing prices are the present value of future rents ignores the fact that unlike dividends on stocks, rent is not discretionary. Housing price uncertainty can affect household property investments, which in turn affect rent. By extending the theory of investment under uncertainty, we model the renters decision to buy a house and the landlords decision to sell as the exercising of real options of waiting and examine real options effects on rent. Using data from Hong Kong and mainland China, we find a significant effect of housing price on rent and draw important policy implications.  Keywords:

Abstract This paper is concerned with selecting important covariates and estimating the index direction simultaneously for high dimensional single-index models. We develop an efficient Threshold Gradient Directed Regularization method via maximizing Distance Covariance (DC-TGDR) between the single index and response variable. Due to the appealing property of distance covariance which can measure nonlinear dependence between random variables, the proposed method avoids estimating the unknown link function of the single index and dramatically reduces computational complexity compared to other methods that use smoothing techniques. It keeps the model-free advantage from the view of sufficient dimension reduction and requires neither predictors nor response variable to be continuous. In addition, the DC-TGDR method encourages a grouping effect. That is, it is capable of choosing highly correlated covariates in or out of the model together. We examine finite-sample performance of the proposed method by Monte Carlo simulations. In a real data analysis, we identify important copy number alterations (CNAs) for gene expression.

Abstract In this article we develop a tractable procedure for testing strict stationarity in a double autoregressive model and formulate the problem as testing if the top Lyapunov exponent is negative. Without strict stationarity assumption, we construct a consistent estimator of the associated top Lyapunov exponent and employ a random weighting approach for its variance estimation, which in turn are used in a t-type test. We also propose a GLAD estimation for parameters of interest, relaxing key assumptions on the commonly used QMLE. All estimators, except for the intercept, are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal in both stationary and explosive situations. The nite-sample performance of the proposed procedures is evaluated via Monte Carlo simulation studies and a real dataset of interest rates is analyzed.

Abstract In this paper, we propose a new class of regime shift models with flexible switching mechanism that relies on a nonparametric probability function of the observed threshold variables. The proposed models generally embrace traditional threshold models with contaminated threshold variables or heterogeneous threshold values, thus gaining more power in handling complicated data structure. We solve the identification issue by imposing either global shape restriction or boundary condition on the nonparametric probability function. We utilize the natural connection between penalized splines and hierarchical Bayes to conduct smoothing. By adopting different priors, our procedure could work well for estimations of smooth curve as well as discontinuous curves with occasionally structural breaks. Bayesian tests for the existence of threshold effects are also conducted based on the posterior samples from Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Both simulation studies and an empirical application in predicting the U.S. stock market returns demonstrate the validity of our methods.

Abstract In this article, we propose a new class of semiparametric instrumental variable models with partially varying coefficients, in which the structural function has a partially linear form and the impact of endogenous structural variables can vary over different levels of some exogenous variables. We propose a three-step estimation procedure to estimate both functional and constant coefficients. The consistency and asymptotic normality of these proposed estimators are established. Moreover, a generalized F-test is developed to test whether the functional coefficients are of particular parametric forms with some underlying economic intuitions, and furthermore, the limiting distribution of the proposed generalized F-test statistic under the null hypothesis is established. Finally, we illustrate the finite sample performance of our approach with simulations and two real data examples in economics.

Abstract We model the term structure of implied volatility (TSIV) with an adaptive approach to improve predictability, which treats dynamic time series models of globally time- varying but locally constant parameters and uses a data-driven procedure to ?nd the local optimal interval. We choose two speci?cations of the adaptive models: a simple local AR (LAR) model for a univariate implied volatility series and an adaptive dynamic Nelson-Siegel (ADNS) model of three factors, each based on an LAR, to model the cross- section of the TSIV simultaneously with parsimony. Both LAR and ADNS models uniformly outperform more than a dozen alternative models with signi?cance across maturities for 1-20 day forecast horizons. Measured by RMSE and MAE, the forecast errors of the random walk model can be reduced by between 20% and 60% for the 5 to 20 days ahead forecast. In terms of prediction accuracy of future directional changes, the adaptive models achieve an accuracy range of 60%-90%, which strictly dominates the range of 30%-59% of the alternative models.

Abstract A trading rule that draws on the empirical similarity concept is proposed to simulate the technical trading mentality|one that selectively perceives structural resemblances between market scenarios of the present and the past. In more than half of the nineteen futures markets that we test against for protability of this similarity-based trading rule, we nd evidence of predictive ability that is robust to data-snooping and transaction-cost adjust- ments. When aided by an exit strategy that liquidates the trader's positions across some evenly-spaced time points, this rule generates the most robust returns.

Abstract Cryptocurrencies refer to a type of digital cash that use distributed ledger - or blockchain technology - to provide secure transactions. These currencies are generally misunderstood. While initially dismissed as fads or bubbles, many large central banks are considering launching their own version of national cryptocurrencies. In contrast to most data in nancial economics, there is a plethora of detailed (free) data on the history of every transaction for the cryptocurrency complex. Further, there is little empirically-oriented research on this new asset class. This is an extraordinary research opportunity for academia. We provide a starting point by giving an insight into cryptocurrency mechanisms and detailing summary statistics and focusing on potential future research avenues in nancial economics.

Abstract News move markets and contains incremental information about stock reactions. Future trading volumes, volatility and returns are a ected by sentiments of texts and opinions expressed in articles. Earlier work of sentiment distillation of stock news suggests that risk prole reactions might differ across sectors. Conventional asset pricing theory recognizes the role of a sector and its risk uniqueness that differs from market or rm specic risk. Our research assesses whether incorporating the sentiment distilled from sector specic news carries information about risk proles. Textual analytics applied to about 600K articles leads us with lexical projection and machine learning to classication of sentiment polarities. The texts are scraped from offcial NASDAQ web pages and with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, such as tokenization, lemmatization, a sector specic sentiment is extracted using a lexical approach and a nancial phrase bank. Predicted sentence-level polarities are aggregated into a bullishness measure on a daily basis and fed into a panel regression analysis with sector indicators. Supervised learning with hinge or logistic loss and regularization yields good prediction results of polarity. Compared with standard lexical projections, the supervised learning approach yields superior predictions of sentiment, leading to highly sector specic sentiment reactions. The Consumer Staples, Health Care and Materials sectors show strong risk prole reactions to negative polarity.

Abstract In the present paper we propose a new method, the Penalized Adaptive Method (PAM), for a data driven detection of structural changes in sparse linear models. The method is able to allocate the longest homogeneous intervals over the data sample and simultaneously choose the most proper variables with the help of penalized regression models. The method is simple yet  exible and can be safely applied in high-dimensional cases with dierent sources of parameter changes. Comparing with the adaptive method in linear models, its combination with dimension reduction yields a method which properly selects signicant variables and detects structural breaks while steadily reduces the forecast error in high-dimensional data.

Abstract Starting from well-known empirical stylised facts of nancial time series, we develop dynamic portfolio protection trading strategies based on econometric methods. As a criterion for riskiness we consider the evolution of the value-at-risk spread from a GARCH model with normal innovations relative to a GARCH model with generalised innovations. These generalised innovations may for example follow a Student t, a generalised hyperbolic (GH), an alpha-stable or a Generalised Pareto (GPD) distribution. Our results indicate that the GPD distribution provides the strongest signals for avoiding tail risks. This is not surprising as the GPD distribution arises as a limit of tail behaviour in extreme value theory and therefore is especially suited to deal with tail risks. Out-of-sample backtests on 11 years of DAX futures data, indicate that the dynamic tail-risk protection strategy eectively reduces the tail risk while outperforming traditional portfolio protection strategies. The results are further validated by calculating the statistical signicance of the results obtained using bootstrap methods. A number of robustness tests including application to other assets further underline the eectiveness of the strategy. Finally, by empirically testing for second order stochastic dominance, we nd that risk averse investors would be willing to pay a positive premium to move from a static buy-and-hold investment in the DAX future to the tail-risk protection strategy.

Abstract We investigate default probabilities and default correlations of Merton-type credit portfolio models in stress scenarios where a common risk factor is truncated. The analysis is performed in the class of elliptical distributions, a family of light-tailed to heavy-tailed distributions encompassing many distributions commonly found in nancial modelling. It turns out that the asymptotic limit of default probabilities and default correlations depend on the max-domain of the elliptical distribution's mixing variable. In case the mixing variable is regularly varying, default probabilities are strictly smaller than 1 and default correlations are in (0; 1). Both can be expressed in terms of the Student t-distribution function. In the rapidly varying case, default probabilities are 1 and default correlations are 0. We compare our results to the tail dependence function and discuss implications for credit portfolio modelling.

Abstract Paralleling regulatory developments, we devise value-at-risk and expected shortfall type risk measures for the potential losses arising from using misspecied models when pricing and hedging contingent claims. Essentially, losses from model risk correspond to losses realized on a perfectly hedged position. Model uncertainty is expressed by a set of pricing models, relative to which potential losses are determined. Using market data, a unied loss distribution is attained by weighing models according to a relative likelihood criterion. Examples demonstrate the magnitude of model risk and corresponding capital buers necessary to suciently protect trading book positions against unexpected losses from model risk.

Abstract We investigate correlations of asset returns in stress scenarios where a common risk factor is truncated. Our analysis is performed in the class of normal variance mixture (NVM) models, which encompasses many distributions commonly used in nancial modelling. For the special cases of jointly normally and t-distributed asset returns we derive closed formulas for the correlation under stress. For the NVM distribution, we calculate the asymptotic limit of the correlation under stress, which depends on whether the variables are in the maximum domain of attraction of the Frechet or Gumbel distribution. It turns out that correlations in heavy-tailed NVM models are less sensitive to stress than in medium- or light-tailed models. Our analysis sheds light on the suitability of this model class to serve as a quantitative framework for stress testing, and as such provides valuable information for risk and capital management in nancial institutions, where NVM models are frequently used for assessing capital adequacy. We also demonstrate how our results can be applied for more prudent stress testing.

Abstract In 2012, JPMorgan accumulated a USD 6.2 billion loss on a credit derivatives portfolio, the so-called \London Whale", partly as a consequence of de-correlations of non-perfectly correlated positions that were supposed to hedge each other. Motivated by this case, we devise a factor model for correlations that allows for scenario-based stress-testing of correlations. We derive a number of analytical results related to a portfolio of homogeneous assets. Using the concept of Mahalanobis distance, we show how to identify adverse scenarios of correlation risk. As an example, we apply the factor-model approach to the \London Whale" portfolio and determine the value-at-risk impact from correlation changes. Since our ndings are particularly relevant for large portfolios, where even small correlation changes can have a large impact, a further application would be to stress-test portfolios of central counterparties, which are of systemically relevant size.

Abstract In a continuous-time setting where a risk-averse agent controls the drift of an output process driven by a Brownian motion, optimal contracts are linear in the terminal output; this result is well-known in a setting with moral hazard and  under stronger assumptions  adverse selection.

Abstract In this paper, we study the latent group structure in cryptocurrencies market by forming a dynamic return inferred network with coin attributions. We develop a dynamic covariate-assisted spectral clustering method to detect the communities in dynamic network framework and prove its uniform consistency along the horizons. Applying our new method, we show the return inferred network structure and coin attributions, including algorithm and proof types, jointly determine the market segmentation. Based on the network model, we propose a novel \hard-to-value" measure using the centrality scores. Further analysis reveals that the group with a lower centrality score exhibits stronger short-term return reversals. Cross-sectional return predictability further conrms the economic meanings of our grouping results and reveal important portfolio management implications.

Abstract In this work, we propose to define Gaussian Processes indexed by multidimensional distributions. In the framework where the distributions can be modeled as i.i.d realizations of a measure on the set of distributions, we prove that the kernel defined as the quadratic distance between the transportation maps, that transport each distribution to the barycenter of the distributions, provides a valid covariance function. In this framework, we study the asymptotic properties of this process, proving micro ergodicity of the parameters.   Keywords:  Gaussian Process, Kernel methods, Wasserstein Distance

Abstract We consider a problem of multiclass classification, where the training sample Sn = {(Xi, Yi)}n i=1 is generated from the model P(Y = m|X = x) = m(x), 1 6 m 6 M, and 1(x), . . . , M(x) are unknown Lip- schitz functions. Given a test point X, our goal is to estimate 1(X), . . . , M(X). An approach based on nonparametric smoothing uses a localization technique, i.e. the weight of observation (Xi, Yi) depends on the distance between Xi and X. However, local estimates strongly depend on localiz- ing scheme. In our solution we fix several schemes , . . . ,WK, compute corresponding local estimates e(1), . . . , e(K) for each of them and apply an aggregation procedure. We propose an algorithm, which constructs a con- vex combination of the estimates e(1), . . . , e(K) such that the aggregated estimate behaves approximately as well as the best one from the collection e(1), . . . , e(K). We also study theoretical properties of the procedure, prove oracle results and establish rates of convergence under mild assumptions.   Keywords:

Abstract Let ; : : : ;Xn be i.i.d. sample in Rp with zero mean and the covariance matrix  . The classic principal component analysis esti- mates the projector P J onto the direct sum of some eigenspaces of  by its empirical counterpart bPJ . Recent papers [20, 23] investigate the asymptotic distribution of the Frobenius distance between the projectors k bPJ ??P J  . The problem arises when one tries to build a condence set for the true projector eectively. We consider the problem from Bayesian perspective and derive an approximation for the posterior distribution of the Frobenius distance between projectors. The derived theorems hold true for non-Gaussian data: the only assumption that we impose is the con- centration of the sample covariance b in a vicinity of  . The obtained results are applied to construction of sharp condence sets for the true pro- jector. Numerical simulations illustrate good performance of the proposed procedure even on non-Gaussian data in quite challenging regime.

Abstract In this paper, we consider a probabilistic setting where the probability measures are considered to be random objects. We propose a procedure of construction non-asymptotic confidence sets for empirical barycenters in 2 -Wasserstein space and develop the idea further to construction of a non-parametric two-sample test that is then applied to the detection of structural breaks in data with complex geometry. Both procedures mainly rely on the idea of multiplier bootstrap (Spokoiny and Zhilova [29], Chernozhukov, Chetverikov and Kato [13]). The main focus lies on probability measures that have commuting covariance matrices and belong to the same scatter-location family: we proof the validity of a bootstrap procedure that allows to compute confidence sets and critical values for a Wasserstein-based two-sample test.   Keywords:  Wasserstein barycenters, hypothesis testing, multiplier bootstrap, change point detection, confidence sets.

Abstract Let , . . . ,Xn be i.i.d. sample in Rp with zero mean and the covariance matrix . The problem of recovering the projector onto an eigenspace of  from these observations naturally arises in many applications. Recent technique from [9] helps to study the asymp- totic distribution of the distance in the Frobenius norm kPr - bP r between the true projector Pr on the subspace of the rth eigenvalue and its empirical counterpart bP r in terms of the effective rank of . This paper offers a bootstrap procedure for building sharp confidence sets for the true projector Pr from the given data. This procedure does not rely on the asymptotic distribution of kPr - bP r and its moments. It could be applied for small or moderate sample size n and large dimension p. The main result states the validity of the proposed procedure for finite samples with an explicit error bound for the er- ror of bootstrap approximation. This bound involves some new sharp results on Gaussian comparison and Gaussian anti-concentration in high-dimensional spaces. Numeric results confirm a good performance of the method in realistic examples.   Keywords:

Abstract We distill sentiment from a huge assortment of NASDAQ news articles by means of machine learning methods and examine its predictive power in single-stock option markets and equity markets. We provide evidence that single-stock options react to contemporaneous sentiment. Next, examining return predictability, we discover that while option variables indeed predict stock returns, sentiment variables add further informational content. In fact, both in a regression and a trading context, option variables orthogonalized to public and sentimental news are even more informative predictors of stock returns. Distinguishing further between overnight and trading-time news, we find the first to be more informative. From a statistical topic model, we uncover that this is attributable to the differing thematic coverage of the alternate archives. Finally, we show that sentiment disagreement commands a strong positive risk premium above and beyond market volatility and that lagged returns predict future returns in concentrated sentiment environments.

Abstract The New Keynesian theory of inflation determination has been under scrutiny due to identification issues, which rather have to do with the mechanism of inflation determination at its core (i.e. Cochrane (2011)). Moreover, similar identification problems arise in the case of fiscal inflation (see for example Leeper and Leith (2016), Leeper and Li (2017) and Leeper and Walker (2012)). This paper makes a positive contribution. We argue that statements about observational equivalence stem from referring to the equilibrium path, while this should not be our primary source of identifying restrictions. Moreover, policy identification (or lack thereof) relies on assumptions on the underlying shock structure, which is unobservable. We instead extract shocks using heterogeneous uncertain restrictions and external datasets, that is, we learn from errors. We are then able to recover deep and policy parameters irrespective of the prevailing equilibrium. We provide time varying evidence on the efficacy of policy in stabilizing the US economy and on the time varying plausibility of Ricardian versus non-Ricardian price determination. Results are work in progress.   Keywords:  Monetary and fiscal policy, Price Determination, Identification, Learning from errors

Abstract We consider the estimation and inference in a system of high-dimensional regression equations allowing for temporal and cross-sectional dependency in covariates and error processes, covering rather general forms of weak dependence. A sequence of large-scale regressions with LASSO is applied to reduce the dimensionality, and an overall penalty level is carefully chosen by a block multiplier bootstrap procedure to account for multiplicity of the equations and dependencies in the data. Correspondingly, oracle properties with a jointly selected tuning parameter are derived. We further provide high-quality de-biased simultaneous inference on the many target parameters of the system. We provide bootstrap consistency results of the test procedure, which are based on a general Bahadur representation for the Z-estimators with dependent data. Simulations demonstrate good performance of the proposed inference procedure. Finally, we apply the method to quantify spillover effects of textual sentiment indices in a financial market and to test the connectedness among sectors.

Abstract In this paper, we propose a new class of regime shift models with  exible switching mechanism that relies on a nonparametric probability function of the observed thresh- old variables. The proposed models generally embrace traditional threshold models with contaminated threshold variables or heterogeneous threshold values, thus gaining more power in handling complicated data structure. We solve the identification issue by imposing either global shape restriction or boundary condition on the nonparametric probability function. We utilize the natural connection between penalized splines and hierarchical Bayes to conduct smoothing. By adopting dierent priors, our procedure could work well for estimations of smooth curve as well as discontinuous curves with occasionally structural breaks. Bayesian tests for the existence of threshold eects are also conducted based on the posterior samples from Markov chain Monte Carlo (M- CMC) methods. Both simulation studies and an empirical application in predicting the U.S. stock market returns demonstrate the validity of our methods.

Abstract Given data y and k covariates xj one problem in linear regression is to decide which if any of the covariates to include when regressing the dependent variable y on the covariates xj . In this paper three such methods, lasso, knockoff and Gaussian covariates are compared using simulations and real data. The Gaussian covariate method is based on exact probabilities which are valid for all y and xj making it model free. Moreover the probabilities agree with those based on the F-distribution for the standard linear model with i.i.d. Gaussian errors. It is conceptually, mathematically and algorithmically very simple, it is very fast and makes no use of simulations. It outperforms lasso and knockoff in all respects by a considerable margin.

Abstract This paper presents a new approach to non-parametric cluster analysis called Adaptive Weights Clustering (AWC). The idea is to identify the clustering structure by checking at different points and for dierent scales on departure from local homogeneity. The proposed procedure describes the clustering structure in terms of weights wij each of them measures the degree of local inhomogeneity for two neighbor local clusters using statistical tests of \no gap" between them. The procedure starts from very local scale, then the parameter of locality grows by some factor at each step. The method is fully adaptive and does not require to specify the number of clusters or their structure. The clustering results are not sensitive to noise and outliers, the procedure is able to recover dierent clusters with sharp edges or manifold structure. The method is scalable and computationally feasible. An intensive numerical study shows a state-of-the-art performance of the method in various articial examples and applications to text data. Our theoretical study states optimal sensitivity of AWC to local inhomogeneity.   Keywords:  adaptive weights, clustering, gap coecient, manifold clustering

Abstract We investigate the concept of connectedness, which is important for risk measurement and management inGerman energy market. Understanding and learning from these mechanisms are essential to avoid future systemic disasters. To deal with large portfolio selection, we propose regularization approach to capture the spillover and contagion effects acrossGerman power derivatives. This paper shows how network analysis can facilitate the monitoring of futures price movements. Our methodology combines high-dimensional variable selection techniques with network analysis, the results show that contracts like Phelix Base Year Options and Phelix Peak Year Futures are in the core of the Energy futures market.

Abstract This paper analyzes the market impact of limit order books (LOB) taking crossstock effects into account. Based on penalized vector autoregressive approach, we aim to identify significance and magnitude of the directed network channels within and between LOBs by bootstrapped impulse response functions. Moreover, information on asymmetries and imbalances within the LOB over time would be derived. For the sample of a NASDAQ blue-chip portfolio during 06-07/2016 we find that LOB network effects crucially determine prices and bid-ask asymmetries are prevalent.

Abstract Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are establishing themselves as an investment asset and are often named the New Gold. This study, however, shows that the two assets could barely be more dierent. Firstly, we analyze and compare conditional variance properties of Bitcoin and Gold as well as other assets and nd dierences in their structure. Secondly, we implement a BEKK-GARCH model to estimate time-varying conditional correlations. Gold plays an important role in nancial markets with  ight-to-quality in times of market distress. Our results show that Bitcoin behaves as the exact opposite and it positively correlates with downward markets. Lastly, we analyze the properties of Bitcoin as portfolio component and nd no evidence for hedging capabilities. We conclude that Bitcoin and Gold feature fundamentally dierent properties as assets and linkages to equity markets. Our results hold for the broad cryptocurrency index CRIX. As of now, Bitcoin does not re ect any distinctive properties of Gold other than asymmetric response in variance.

Abstract Trading of Bitcoin is spread about multiple venues where buying and selling is offered in various currencies. However, all markets trade one common good and by the law of one price, the different prices should not deviate in the long run. In this context we are interested in which platform is the most important one in terms of price discovery. To this end, we use a pairwise approach accounting for a potential impact of exchange rates. The contribution to price discovery is measured by Hasbrouck's and Gonzalo and Granger's information share. We then derive an ordering with respect to the importance of each market which reveals that the Chinese OKCoin platform is the leader in price discovery of Bitcoin, followed by BTC China.

Abstract Data from social media has created opportunities to understand how and why people move through their urban environment and how this relates to criminal activity. To aid resource allocation decisions in the scope of predictive policing, the paper proposes an approach to predict weekly crime counts. The novel approach captures spatial dependency of criminal activity through approximating human dynamics. It integrates point of interest data in the form of Foursquare venues with Twitter activity and taxi trip data, and introduces a set of approaches to create features from these data sources. Empirical results demonstrate the explanatory and predictive power of the novel features. Analysis of a six-month period of real-world crime data for the city of New York evidences that both temporal and static features are necessary to eectively account for human dynamics and predict crime counts accurately. Furthermore, results provide new evidence into the underlying mechanisms of crime and give implications for crime analysis and intervention.

Abstract Marketing messages are most effective if they reach the right customers. Deciding which customers to contact is thus an important task in campaign planning. The paper focuses on empirical targeting models. We argue that common practices to develop such models do not account sufficiently for business goals. To remedy this, we propose profit-conscious ensemble selection, a modeling framework that integrates statistical learning principles and business objectives in the form of campaign profit maximization. The results of a comprehensive empirical study confirm the business value of the proposed approach in that it recommends substantially more profitable target groups than several benchmarks.

Abstract New Public Management helps universities and research institutions to perform in a highly competitive research environment. Evaluating publicly financed research results improves transparency, helps in reflection and self-assessment, and provides information for strategic decision making. In this paper we provide empirical evidence using data from a Collaborative Research Centre (CRC) on financial inputs and research output from 2005 to 2016. After selecting performance indicators suitable for a CRC, we describe main properties of the data using visualization techniques. To study the relationship between the dimensions of research performance, we use a time fixed effects panel data model and fixed effects Poisson model. With the help of year dummy variables, we show how the pattern of research productivity changed over time after controlling for staff and travel costs. The joint depiction of the time fixed effects and the research projects life cycle allows a better understanding of the development of the number of discussion papers over time.

Abstract Many Southeast European countries are currently undergoing a process of liberalization of electric power markets. The paper analyses day-ahead price dynamics on some of these new markets and in Germany as a benchmark of a completely decentralized Western European market. To that end, several price forecasting methods including autoregressive approaches, multiple linear regression, and neural networks are considered. These methods are tested on hourly day-ahead price data during four two-week periods corresponding to different seasons and varying levels of volatility in all selected markets. The most influential fundamental factors are determined and performance of forecasting techniques is analysed with respect to the age of the market, its degree of liberalization, and the level of volatility. A comparison of Southeast European electricity markets of different age with the older German market is made and clusters of similar Southeast European markets are identified.

Abstract The recent emergence of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies has received a considerable attention. The growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies has led many to speculate that the blockchain technology can surpass a traditional centralized monetary system. However, no monetary model has yet been de- veloped to study the economics of the blockchain. This paper builds a model of the economy with a single generally acepted blockchain-based currency. In the spirit of the search and matching literature I use a matching function to model the operation of the blockchain. The formulation of the money demand is taken from a workhorse of monetary economics - Lagos and Wright (2005). I show that in a blockchain-based monetary system money demand features a precautionary motive which is absent in the standard Lagos-Wright model. Due to this precautionary money demand the monetary equilibrium can be stable for some calibrations. I also used the developed model to study how the equilibrium return on money is  Keywords:  Blockchain, Miners, Cryptocurrency, Matching function

Abstract We link the hiring of R&D scientists from industry competitors to the subsequent formation of collaborative agreements, namely technology-oriented alliances. By transferring technological knowledge as well as cognitive elements to the hiring firm, mobile inventors foster the alignment of decision frames applied by potential alliance partners in the process of alliance formation thereby making collaboration more likely. Using data on inventor mobility and alliance formation amongst 42 global pharmaceutical firms over 16 years, we show that inventor mobility is positively associated with the likelihood of alliance formation in periods following inventor movements. This relationship becomes more pronounced if mobile employees bring additional knowledge about their prior firms technological capabilities and for alliances aimed at technology development rather than for agreements related to technology transfer. It is weakened, however, if the focal firm is already familiar with the competitors technological capabilities. By revealing these relationships, our study contributes to research on alliance formation, employee mobility, and organizational frames.   Keywords:    JEL classication:

Abstract The recent development of private cryptocurrencies has created a need to extend existing models of private currency provision and currency competi- tion. The outcome of cryptocurrency competition should be analyzed in a model which incorporates important features of the modern cryptocurren- cies. In this paper I focus on two such features. First, cryptocurrencies operate according to a protocol - a blockchain - and are, therefore, free from the time-inconsistency problem. Second, the operation of the blockchain costs real resources. I use the Lagos-Wright search theoretic monetary model augmented with privately issued currencies as in Fernandez-Villaverde and Sanches (2016) and extend it by linear costs of private currency circulation. I show that in contrast to Fernandez-Villaverde and Sanches (2016) cryptocur- rency competition 1) does not deliver price stability and 2) puts downward pressure on the in ation in the public currency only when the costs private currency circulation (mining costs) are suciently low.

Testing for bubbles in cryptocurrencies with time-varying volatility Christian M. Hafner Abstract The recent evolution of cryptocurrencies has been characterized by bubble-like behavior and extreme volatility. While it is difficult to assess an intrinsic value to a specific cryptocurrency, one can employ recently proposed bubble tests that rely on recursive applications of classical unit root tests. This paper extends this approach to the case where volatility is time varying, assuming a deterministic longrun component that may take into account a decrease of unconditional volatility when the cryptocurrency matures with a higher market dissemination. Volatility also includes a stochastic short-run component to capture volatility clustering. The wild bootstrap is shown to correctly adjust the size properties of the bubble test, which retains good power properties. In an empirical application using eleven of the largest cryptocurrencies and the CRIX index, the general evidence in favor of bubbles is confirmed, but much less pronounced than under constant volatility.

Abstract The CRIX (CRyptocurrency IndeX) has been constructed based on a number of cryptos and provides a high coverage of market liquidity, hu.berlin/crix. The crypto currency market is a new asset market and attracts a lot of investors recently. Surprisingly a market for contingent claims hat not been built up yet. A reason is certainly the lack of pricing tools that are based on solid financial econometric tools. Here a first step towards pricing of derivatives of this new asset class is presented. After a careful econometric pre-analysis we motivate an affine jump diffusion model, i.e., the SVCJ (Stochastic Volatility with Correlated Jumps) model. We calibrate SVCJ by MCMC and obtain interpretable jump processes and then via simulation price options. The jumps present in the cryptocurrency fluctutations are an essential component. Concrete examples are given to establish an OCRIX exchange platform trading options on CRIX.   Keywords:  CRyptocurrency IndeX, CRIX, Bitcoin,Cryptocurrency, SVCJ, Option pricing,OCRIX

Abstract With option-implied volatility indices, we provide a new tool for event studies in a network setting and document systemic risk in the spillover networks across global financial markets. Network linkages are sufficiently asymmetric because the US stock and bond markets play as dominant volatility suppliers to other countries and markets. Shocks from the US generate systemic risk through intensifying volatility spillovers across countries and asset classes. The findings offer new evidence that asymmetric network linkages can lead to sizable aggregate fluctuations and thus potential systemic risk.

Abstract: For multivariate nonparametric regression models, existing variable selection methods with penalization require high-dimensional nonparametric approximations in objective functions. When the dimension is high, none of methods with penalization in the literature are readily available. Also, ranking and screening approaches cannot have selection consistency when iterative algorithms cannot be used due to inefficient nonparametric approximation. In this paper, a novel and easily implemented approach is proposed to make existing methods feasible for selection with no need of nonparametric approximation. Selection consistency can be achieved. As an application to additive regression models, we then suggest a two-stage procedure that separates selection and estimation steps. An adaptive estimation to the smoothness of underlying components can be constructed such that the consistency can be even at parametric rate if the underlying model is really parametric. Simulations are carried out to examine the performance of our method, and a real data example is analyzed for illustration.

Abstract: Appropriate risk management is crucial to ensure the competitiveness of financial institutions and the stability of the economy. One widely used financial risk measure is Value-at-Risk (VaR). VaR estimates based on linear and parametric models can lead to biased results or even underestimation of risk due to time varying volatility, skewness and leptokurtosis of nancial return series. The paper proposes a nonlinear and nonparametric framework to forecast VaR. Mean and volatility are modeled via support vector regression (SVR) where the volatility model is motivated by the standard generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) formulation. Based on this, VaR is derived by applying kernel density estimation (KDE). This approach allows for  exible tail shapes of the profit and loss distribution and adapts for a wide class of tail events. The SVR-GARCH-KDE hybrid is compared to standard, exponential and threshold GARCH models coupled with different error distributions. To examine the performance in different markets, one-day-ahead forecasts are produced for different financial indices. Model evaluation using a likelihood ratio based test framework for interval forecasts indicates that the SVR-GARCH-KDE hybrid performs competitive to benchmark models. Especially models that are coupled with a normal distribution are systematically outperformed.   Keywords: Value-at-Risk, Support Vector Regression, Kernel Density Estimation, GARCH
